This package provides a napari plugin and a command line interface for quantitative label-free microscopy.

In this repository you will find python tools and a napari plugin that allow the user to calibrate microscope hardware, acquire multi-modal data, reconstruct density and anisotropy, and visualize the results.

The acquisition, calibration, background correction, reconstruction, and applications of QLIPP (quantitative label-free imaging with phase and polarization)  are described in the following [E-Life Paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55502):

`recOrder` is to be used alongside a conventional widefield microscope fitted with a universal polarizer (Panel A below).  The universal polarizer allows for the collection of label-free information including the intrinsic anisotropy of the sample and its relative phase (density). These measurements are collected by acquiring data under calibrated, polarization-diverse illumination followed by a computational reconstruction.  The overall structure of `recOrder` is shown in Panel B, highlighting the two different usage modes and their features: graphical user interface (GUI) through a napari plugin, and a command line interface (CLI).

## Quick Start

(Optional but recommended) install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and create a virtual environment:

```sh
conda create -y -n recOrder python=3.9
conda activate recOrder
```

> *Apple Silicon users please use*:
>
> ```sh
> CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda create -y -n recOrder python=3.9
> conda activate recOrder
> ```

Install `recOrder-napari`:

```sh
pip install recOrder-napari
```

Open `napari` with `recOrder-napari`:

```sh
napari -w recOrder-napari
```

View command-line help by running

```sh
recOrder.help
```
