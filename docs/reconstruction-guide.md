# Automating reconstructions

`recOrder` uses a configuration-file-based command-line interface (CLI) to perform all reconstructions.

## How can I use `recOrder`'s CLI to perform reconstructions?
`recOrder`'s CLI is summarized in the following figure:

The main command `reconstruct` command is composed of two subcommands: `compute-tf` and `apply-inv-tf`. 

A reconstruction can be performed with a single `reconstruct` call. For example:
```
recorder reconstruct `
    -i ./data.zarr/*/*/* `
    -c ./config.yml `
    -o ./reconstruction.zarr
```
Equivalently, a reconstruction can be performed with a `compute-tf` call followed by an `apply-inv-tf` call. For example:
```
recorder compute-tf `
    -i ./data.zarr/0/0/0 `
    -c ./config.yml `
    -o ./tf.zarr

recorder apply-inv-tf 
    -i ./data.zarr/*/*/* `
    -t ./tf.zarr `
    -c ./config.yml `
    -o ./reconstruction.zarr
```
Computing the transfer function is typically the most expensive part of the reconstruction, so saving a transfer function then applying it to many datasets can save time. 

## What types of reconstructions are supported?
See `/recOrder/examples/` for a list of example configuration files. 

TODO: Expand this documentation...need docs for each reconstruction type and parameter.
