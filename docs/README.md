# Welcome to `recOrder`'s documentation

**I would like to install `recOrder` on my microscope:** start with the [microscope installation guide](./microscope-installation-guide.md).

**(outdated) I would like to watch an experienced user introduce `recOrder`**: [watch the tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tHLHZ_uUnddb3jzXnQUjUiynSDS8XIy2/view?usp=sharing). 

**I would like to set up a development environment and test `recOrder`**: start with the [development guide](./development-guide.md)

**I noticed an error in the documentation or code:** [open an issue](https://github.com/mehta-lab/recOrder/issues/new/choose) or [send us an email](mailto:shalin.mehta@czbiohub.org,talon.chandler@czbiohub.org). We appreciate your help!
