# `recOrder` development guide

## Install `recOrder` for development

1. Install [conda](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) and create a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    conda create -y -n recOrder python=3.10
    conda activate recOrder
    ```

2. Clone the `recOrder` directory:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mehta-lab/recOrder.git
    ```

3. Install `recOrder` in editable mode with development dependencies

    ```sh
    cd recOrder
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

4. Optionally, for the co-development of [`waveorder`](https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder) and `recOrder`:

    > Note that `pip` will raise an 'error' complaining that the dependency of `recOrder-napari` has been broken if you do the following.
    > This does not affect the installation, but can be suppressed by removing [this line](https://github.com/mehta-lab/recOrder/blob/5bc9314a9bacf6f4e235eaffb06c297cf20e4b65/setup.cfg#L40) before installing `waveorder`.
    > (Just remember to revert the change afterwards!)
    > We expect a nicer behavior to be possible once we release a stable version of `waveorder`.

    ```sh
    cd # where you want to clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder.git
    pip install ./waveorder -e ".[dev]"
    ```

    > Importing from a local and/or editable package can cause issues with static code analyzers such due to the absence of the source code from the paths they expect.
    > VS Code users can refer to [this guide](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#common-questions-and-issues) to resolve typing warnings.

## Set up a development environment

### Code linting

We are not currently specifying a code linter as most modern Python code editors already have their own. If not, add a plugin to your editor to help catch bugs pre-commit!

### Code formatting

We use `black` to format Python code, and a specific version is installed as a development dependency. Use the `black` in the `recOrder` virtual environment, either from commandline or the editor of your choice.

> *VS Code users*: Install the [Black Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter) plugin. Press `^/⌘ ⇧ P` and type 'format document with...', choose the Black Formatter and start formatting!

### Docstring style

The [NumPy style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) docstrings are used in `recOrder`.

> *VS Code users*: [this popular plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring) helps auto-generate most popular docstring styles (including `numpydoc`).

## Run automated tests

From within the `recOrder` directory run:

```sh
pytest
```

Running `pytest` for the first time will download ~50 MB of test data from Zenodo, and subsequent runs will reuse the downloaded data.

## Run manual tests

Although many of `recOrder`'s tests are automated, many features require manual testing. The following is a summary of features that need to be tested manually before release:

* Install a compatible version of Micro-Manager and check that `recOrder` can connect.
* Perform calibrations with and without an ROI; with and without a shutter configured in Micro-Manager, in 4- and 5-state modes; and in MM-Voltage, MM-Retardance, and DAC modes (if the TriggerScope is available).  
* Test "Load Calibration" and "Calculate Extinction" buttons.
* Test "Capture Background" button.
* Test the "Acquire Birefringence" button on a background FOV. Does a background-corrected background acquisition give random orientations?
* Test the four "Acquire" buttons with varied combinations of 2D/3D, background correction settings, "Phase from BF" checkbox, and regularization parameters.
* Use the data you collected to test "Offline" mode reconstructions with varied combinations of parameters.  

## GUI development

We use `QT Creator` for large parts of `recOrder`'s GUI. To modify the GUI, install `QT Creator` from [its website](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools) or with `brew install --cask qt-creator`

Open `./recOrder/plugin/gui.ui` in `QT Creator` and make your changes.

Next, convert the `.ui` to a `.py` file with:

```sh
pyuic5 -x gui.ui -o gui.py
```

Note: `pyuic5` is installed alongside `PyQt5`, so you can expect to find it installed in your `recOrder` conda environement.

Finally, change the `gui.py` file's to import `qtpy` instead of `PyQt5` to adhere to [napari plugin best practices](https://napari.org/stable/plugins/best_practices.html#don-t-include-pyside2-or-pyqt5-in-your-plugin-s-dependencies).
On macOS, you can modify the file in place with:

```sh
sed -i '' 's/from PyQt5/from qtpy/g' gui.py
```

> This is specific for BSD `sed`, omit `''` with GNU.

Note: although much of the GUI is specified in the generated `recOrder_ui.py` file, the `main_widget.py` file makes extensive modifications to the GUI.

## Make `git blame` ignore formatting commits

**Note:** `git --version` must be `>=2.23` to use this feature.

If you would like `git blame` to ignore formatting commits, run this line:

```sh
 git config --global blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

The `\.git-blame-ignore-revs` file contains a list of commit hashes corresponding to formatting commits.
If you make a formatting commit, please add the commit's hash to this file.

## Pre-release checklist 
- merge `README.md` figures to `main`, then update the links to point to these uploaded figures. We do not upload figures to PyPI, so without this step the README figure will not appear on PyPI or napari-hub. 
- update version numbers and links in [the microscope dependency guide](./microscope-installation-guide.md).
